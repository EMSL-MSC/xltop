xltop is a continuous Lustre monitor with batch scheduler intergation.

The organization of xltop is shown below and consists of a single
master process (xltop-master), an ncurses based client (xltop), 

                     xltop-master
                     /    |    \
                    /     |     \
                   /      |      \
               xltop      |   xltop-servd
         (ncurses client) | (MDS/OSS monitor daemon)
                          |
                     xltop-clusd
                (job mapping daemon)

The design of xltop assumes that:
 1) file systems may be mounted by multiple clusters,
 2) hosts may belong to multiple lnets,
 3) the same lnet name (for example o2ib) may be used multiple times,

Build requires ncurses, libcurl, libev-4.4, and libconfuse-2.7.
